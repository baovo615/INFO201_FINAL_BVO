who play the game mode called Arena. The information shows the Gamertag of
the player which is a unique identifier per character. The next two columns
have the total number of kills and deaths the player has in the match. Lastly,
the last column is the Kill Death Ratio of the player in that match. The Kill
Death Ratio per player in a match is important because having a high Kill Death
Ratio will allow the character to receive certain rewards in the game.")
