In this project our group decided to use the Halo 5 API and gather information on players. Here is a breakdown of what some of us decided to do.

Muhammad:
- What is the average kill death ratio for the top players in Halo 5?

Luxi:
- How are the number of hours played distributed for top ranked players?

Bao:
- How does service time correlate with skill level?

Zixin:
- Which game mode do players have the longest lifetime?

The API provides information like results of a match, history of matches per player, match leaderboards, and player service records. The overall audience that we are trying to present our information is Halo 5 players who are interested in the player stats of the top players in the world. We plan to present our information by creating a shiny app in R and use different data visualization methods to present our findings from the API.

**Disclaimer: Due to a restriction on the number of calls from the API per second, we have created CSV files from the API to reduce the load times**
